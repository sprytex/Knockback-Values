# Knockback-Values
This is a list filled with knockback values old servers used like Kohi, MineHQ, Badlion, etc. 
This was mainly created so people stop obsessing over knockback and creating random servers claiming they have x knockback. 

NOTE: You will need to edit your spigot for certain configurations to work. Although some configurations have been translated to the vanilla format so you won't need to.

Yes, these are the real values, not some remake. Enjoy!
